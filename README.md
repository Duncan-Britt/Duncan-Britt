- 👋 Hi, I’m Duncan Britt
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, music, urban planning, architecture, and investing, among other things. I love to build, I love to read, and I'm excited to solve problems that are worth solving.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about computational thinking and problem solving as I work my way through the [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/) core curriculum.
- 📫 You can reach me by email: dbru997 at g mail
